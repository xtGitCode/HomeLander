# HomeLander Safety Application
 During life-threatening emergencies, quick and automatic contact with close contacts
 can make a difference between life and death. However, in the reality of dangerous situations
 such as kidnappings, assaults and accidents, many people cannot manually call for help and
 share their location. Recognizing the challenges individuals face in ensuring their safety and
 well-being, HomeLander aims to provide a robust solution that empowers users to
 proactively manage and communicate in emergency scenarios. Key objectives include:
 1. **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Provide users with accurate and real-time location tracking
 using the Google Maps API and GPS to enhance the precision of emergency response.
 2. **Automated Communication**: Implement an automated communication system through
 Whatsapp or SMS, allowing users to swiftly and efficiently notify their emergency contacts with
 essential details.
 3. **User-Defined Check-In Alerts**: Enable users to set personalized check-in alerts, prompting
 them to confirm their well-being at specified intervals. Failure to respond within the designated
 time activates an emergency mode.
4. **Emergency Contacts Management**: Facilitate the management of emergency contacts,
 allowing users to add, edit, or delete contacts seamlessly.
 5. **Secure Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication through Firebase, ensuring that
 only authorized users can access and utilize the application's features.
